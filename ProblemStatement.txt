Downtown Streets Team is looking to change the perception of homelessness in the Bay Area.
We are inviting people be part off this change by allowing the community to use our app and help
change those perceptions. The app lets people request clean ups. We dispatch the team, we send back a picture to say its done.
At that time the community member will have the option to donate.
